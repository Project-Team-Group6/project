CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING ALOGORITHUM

PROJECT NAME: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
 
 DESCRIPTION:
          Credit Card Fraud can be defined as a case where a person uses someone elseâ€™s credit card for personal reasons while the owner and the card-issuing authorities are unaware of the fact that the card is being used. Fraud detection involves monitoring and analyzing the behavior of various users to estimate detects or avoid undesirable behavior.To identify credit card fraud detection effectively, we need to understand the various technologies, algorithms and types involved in detecting credit card frauds. The algorithm can differentiate transactions which are fraudulent or not.
